# LEETCODE-Arrays-3432
Here’s the **step-by-step dry run** for the code with
`nums = [10, 10, 3, 7, 6]`.

---
# ▶️ **Step 1: n = nums.length**

`nums = [10, 10, 3, 7, 6]`

So,

```
n = 5
```

---

# ▶️ **Step 2: sum = Arrays.stream(nums).sum()**

Compute total:

```
10 + 10 + 3 + 7 + 6 = 36
```

So,

```
sum = 36
```

---

# ▶️ **Step 3: Check condition (sum % 2 == 0)**

```
36 % 2 = 0 → even
```

Condition is TRUE.

---

# ▶️ **Step 4: Return n - 1**

```
n - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4
```

---

# ✅ **Final Output: `4`**
